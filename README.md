# Simple HTML Website

A basic website built with only **HTML** to demonstrate my understanding of HTML structure and elements.

## What I learned

- HTML tags and elements  
- Creating headings, paragraphs, lists, and links  
- Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML  
- Basic page layout without CSS or JavaScript

## How to use

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.
